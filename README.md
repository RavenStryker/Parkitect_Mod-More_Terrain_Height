# Improved Landscape Height

Mod Inventor/Upkeep: RavenStryker

Project Author: ChrisBradel

Description: Improve your scenarios with a more dynamic landscape! Increases the default landscape height from 16 units, to 30 units! You can build on all the land as well!



Note: If you create landscape above the default 16 unit height with this mod and someone else opens it without the mod, the landscape will stay as it is unless they attempt to edit the landscape. At that point, it will snap back down to the default 16 unit height. I would recommend preventing landscape manipulation to circumvent this issue.



Another Note: Due to another limitation in the game, the max this can currently be set to is 32 units, but at that high you cannot build rides due to the game thinking the park does not have right to build there. So I kept it at 30 units for a bit of flex and reliability for park builds.
